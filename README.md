# Simplechart Dev Site

This repo exists for testing the [WordPress Simplechart](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wordpress-simplechart) plugin on a clean site.

The master branch of this repo is deployed automatically to http://dev-simplechart.alleydev.com/

You can use the plugin as expected inside WordPress, or see a standalone version of the chart editor app (here)[http://dev-simplechart.alleydev.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=simplechart_app&noheader]

### Coming soon...

* Auto-deployment of the `develop` branch of the plugin and underlying JS application(s) to the `master` branch of this repo
* Documentation on how to switch the version of the app
